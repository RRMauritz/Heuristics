Iterated Greedy (IG) algorithm for solving the symmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). 
The cost of an edge is merely defined by the euclidean distance between the two adjacent cities. 

The used data is from the [TSPLIB library](http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/index.html)

For information on IG, see [St√ºtzle et al.](https://iridia.ulb.ac.be/IridiaTrSeries/link/IridiaTr2018-006.pdf)
